# attoDuino

Used to be hosted at www.attoduino.com.  Some history is preserved here, 
the way back machine (https://archive.org/web/) and Kickstarter.   

An original copy of the AttoDuino-1.0-Schematic.pdf can be found in the docs
directory.

The original Github site is https://github.com/JonHub/attoDuino which is compatible
with the Arduino IDE version 1.6.1 or earlier.

See Wiki pages for additional information on how to adapt to recent versions of
the Arduino IDE.
